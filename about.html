          and dedicated security professionals committed to safeguarding people,

        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Adventura DulceMio was founded with a clear vision: to raise the
          standard of private security in the UK. Our founder, with decades of
          combined experience in Spain and the UK in crowd management, and
          private security, recognised the need for a company that valued
          professionalism, reliability, and respect as much as it valued
          physical protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          From our early beginnings providing door supervision for local pubs
          and nightclubs, we quickly expanded into wider sectors — offering
          comprehensive security for corporate premises, construction sites,
          retail environments, and private events. Today, we’re proud to serve
          clients across England, Scotland, and Wales, maintaining the same
          personalised approach that has been our hallmark since day one.

        <h2>Our Mission and Vision</h2>
        <p>
          At Adventura DulceMio LTD, our mission is to deliver security
          solutions that make people feel safe, valued, and respected. We don’t
          see security as just a service; we see it as a partnership. Our goal
          is to integrate seamlessly into our clients’ operations, providing not
          just a physical presence but also reassurance, professionalism, and
          support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our vision is to become the UK’s most trusted and respected name in
          private security. We aim to achieve this by maintaining the highest
          operational standards, investing in continuous training, and adapting
          to new challenges in an ever-changing world.

        <h2>Our People</h2>
        <p>
          At the heart of FortisGuard is our people. Our team is made up of
          experienced security professionals, many of whom come from backgrounds
          in law enforcement, the military, or customer service. This diverse
          experience gives us a balanced, adaptable approach to security.
        </p>
        <p>
          We treat our staff with the same respect we expect them to show our
          clients. We provide fair wages, proper working conditions, and
          opportunities for advancement. A motivated, valued officer performs
          better — and that translates to better results for our clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our recruitment process is meticulous. We look beyond licenses and
          qualifications to find individuals who demonstrate integrity,
          reliability, and emotional intelligence — traits that define the very
          best in this profession.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="about-card">
        <h2>Commitment to Community</h2>
        <p>
          As a UK-based company, we’re deeply rooted in the communities we
          serve. We believe that effective security goes beyond physical
          protection; it’s about fostering trust and contributing to safer, more
          welcoming environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          We regularly collaborate with local councils, police forces, and
          community groups to share insights, support public safety initiatives,
          and maintain open communication. Whether it’s helping reduce
          anti-social behaviour outside local venues or supporting charity
          events, we take pride in being an active part of our community.
        </p>
